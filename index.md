# Examining Changes and Relationships between Clouds, Precipitation, and Precipitable Water in the African Monsoon Region
# Austin Reed
# Introduction
### My dataset of choice is ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1979 to present, which is the fifth generation ECMWF renalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. I plan to look at the variables of total cloud cover, total precipitation, column cloud liquid water, as well as total column cloud water vapor in Africa to answer the question: Has mean precipitable water changed significantly in the African monsoon region over the last 70 years? In which season? And how is that change related to changes in clouds? Some tools that I could use to help solve this question include looking at monthly, and seasonal anomalies over continental Africa, and explore the variance in these anomalies over recent years. This can help to pinpoint statistically significant trends in precipitation, total column precipitable water, cloud cover, and total column liquid water over continental Africa. The continent can be further broken up into sub-regions to highlight the impact of the African monsoon.
